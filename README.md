# Test Task - README

Thank you for reviewing my test task submission. Due to being out of town on a trip, I was unable to submit it in the initial days. I apologize for any inconvenience caused.

I have made an effort to complete the maximum amount of work within the given time frame of 5 hours. I hope to proceed further in the evaluation process and have the opportunity to join your team, contributing to its improvement while enhancing my own knowledge and skills.

Please note that the backend is hosted on a free hosting service, so there might be some delay in the server startup process. Kindly allow some time for the server to launch.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the next steps in the selection process.

Best regards,
Oleksii Romaniv
